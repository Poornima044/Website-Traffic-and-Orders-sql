## üß© Example SQL Query
- Top traffic sources (sessions ‚Üí orders conversion):
SELECT 
  ws.utm_source,
  ws.utm_campaign,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) AS sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
  ROUND(1.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id),0), 4) AS conversion_rate
FROM website_sessions ws
LEFT JOIN orders o ON ws.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
GROUP BY ws.utm_source, ws.utm_campaign
ORDER BY sessions DESC
LIMIT 50;

- Bounce rate for landing page /home (sessions with only 1 pageview):
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE first_pv AS
SELECT website_session_id, MIN(website_pageview_id) AS first_pv
FROM website_pageviews
GROUP BY website_session_id;

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN wp.pageview_url = '/home' THEN f.website_session_id END) AS total_home_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN wp.pageview_url = '/home' AND pv_counts.pageviews = 1 THEN f.website_session_id END) AS bounced_home_sessions,
  ROUND(1.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN wp.pageview_url = '/home' AND pv_counts.pageviews = 1 THEN f.website_session_id END) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN wp.pageview_url = '/home' THEN f.website_session_id END),0), 4) AS bounce_rate
FROM first_pv f
JOIN website_pageviews wp ON f.first_pv = wp.website_pageview_id
JOIN (
  SELECT website_session_id, COUNT(*) as pageviews
  FROM website_pageviews GROUP BY website_session_id
) pv_counts ON pv_counts.website_session_id = f.website_session_id;
